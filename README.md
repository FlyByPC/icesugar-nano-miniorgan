# icesugar-nano-miniorgan
Simple sort-of-polyphonic organ for icesugar nano + audio PMOD

This is a simple mini-organ or mini-piano project for the icesugar nano and the Audio PMOD.

Input is via the double-row PMOD using the 8-switch DIP PMOD sold with the icesugar nano. Notes as currently configured are C4 through C5 (diatonic major scale).

Connect the Audio PMOD to the top single-row PMOD (the one nearest the LED) so that one row of pins rests above the PMOD. (This row is not needed.)
